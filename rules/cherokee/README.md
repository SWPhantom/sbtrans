Cherokee
========

(ᏣᎳᎩ ᎦᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ Tsalagi Gawonihisdi) is the Iroquoian
language spoken by the Cherokee people. It is the only Southern Iroquoian
language that remains spoken.

Note: going back and forth between latin and cherokee will likely not be
correct. See [this
link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_syllabary#Transliteration_issues)
for a more detailed explanation why. Basically, don't do round-trip conversions
or back-transliterations.

History
-------

The Cherokee syllabary is a syllabary invented by Sequoyah to write the
Cherokee language in the late 1810s and early 1820s. His creation of the
syllabary is particularly noteworthy in that he could not previously read any
script. He first experimented with logograms, but his system later developed
into a syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a syllable rather than
a single phoneme; the 85 (originally 86) characters in the Cherokee
syllabary provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Some symbols do resemble
the Latin, Greek and even the Cyrillic scripts' letters, but the sounds are
completely different (for example, the sound /a/ is written with a letter that
resembles Latin D).

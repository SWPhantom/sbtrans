  Transliteration rules must be ordered by the length of the 
  "before" side of each, to prevent rule bleeding.

  Consider the ruleset:  

  [
    ["n", "N"],   # rule 1
    ["na", "NA"]  # rule 2
  ]

  Consider what happens If this ruleset is applied to the 
  string "nana":

  Apply rule 1:  
  
    "nana" -> "NaNa"

  Now rule 2 is blocked!

  The solution is to reorder the rules such that the longest
  rules with the longest input sides are run first. (In this
  example, rule 2 should precede rule 1.

  Basic usage:
  
      $ python sbtrans.py <rule_file> <input_file> <output_file>

  E.g.: 

      $ python sbtrans.py rules/georgian/mkhedruli.json test/georgian/cities.txt test/georgian/cities-roman.txt

  This will read rules from rules/georgian/mkhedruli.json, input text from test/georgian/cities.txt,  
  and write it to test/georgian/cities-roman.txt.

  Advanced usage:

  Read text to be transliterated from STDIN and print it to STDOUT:
  
      $ echo 'Cxu vi parolas?' | python sbtrans.py rules/esperanto/x2full.json 
      Äˆu vi parolas?

  This function is not recommended for use from the interactive Python prompt -- use 
  transliterate() and normal file I/O.

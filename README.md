A minimalist (ha, ha) transliteration library built by UCSB ComplingFTW!

## What is transliteration?

Transliteration is the conversion of a text from one script or alphabet to another. For instance, the Greek phrase "Ελληνική Δημοκρατία" 'Hellenic Republic' can be transliterated as "Ellēnikē Dēmokratia" by substituting Greek letters for Latin letters.


## A Sample Transliteration Scheme

Esperanto letters with diacritics can be converted to plain text by changing the letter to its standard Latin form followed by an x.
